## Weather Dashboard

## Description
This is a Weather Dashboard application, using the Open Weather Map Api, html, CSS and javascript. This application gets the current weather, temperature, wind speed, and humidity for different cities. This application also provides a future 5 day forecast for each city, with the temperature, windspeed, and humidity. The default city for this application is set to Charlotte, Nc. The application allows you to search for a city, and it even allows you to view your search history. This application has a clean user interface, and is convenient and easy to use. This application solves the issue of watching your local weather stations for weather updates. Throughout this project, I advanced my styling skills, as well as my use of JavaScript functions.

## Usage
This application utilizes the Open Weather Map Api for updated weather forecasts. The user can easily run the application and see the current weather and future five days weather for Charlotte as the landing page. The user can search a specific city in the search bar, which will then update the current weather and future forecast for that city. If the user would like to see their search history, they can click the View History button, which will show their recently searched cities. The user can click on each city in their search history, which will refresh the forecasts to that corresponding city.
